## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## What is Memory Game

-   This is a simple  game used to  test the users memory
    ## Challenge
-   Match cards in less time and less moves

## Getting Starer code

Downloaded the starer code from

-   Memory Game project repository on GitHUB: <https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game>
-   The Zipped File : <https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game/archive/master.zip>

## Construction of the code

-   The Memory Game Project is all about demonstrating your mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is constructed in responsive designing too. Steps followed to construct the game are as follows:


-   create an index.html file
-   img folder to store images
-   js folder to construct the functionality of the game
-   css folder to allocate the respective styles required

The game was constructed by performing the DOM manipulations

-   A deck of cards were created and shuffle when the game was refreshed
-   A timer and counter were created to know about the duration of the    game played and count the moves performed by the player
-   added some functions to cards when they got match and unmatched
-   created a pop-up modal box when player wins the game
